# NZ Firearm Crimes Dashboard

A PowerBI dashboard which tracking firearms crimes in New Zealand (NZ). Looks into what crimes use firearms, which firearms were used, and when/where firearms crimes occur.

### Installation:
To access the dashboard, simply download the zip file. It contains the PowerBI file along with the dataset(s) used.

### Motivation:
Recently, I felt there have been an increase in firearm use in NZ. Each week it feels like we see headlines about firearms used in small crimes across the country. So to see if this was true, I created this dashboard to better understand firearm crimes in NZ. 

### Quick Insights:
- From January 2018 to December 2022...
    - There have been 1647 instances of crimes involving firearms.
        - Aggravated Robbery accounts for 51.4% (846) of these occurrences.
- December 2022 saw a 30.23% decrease in firearm crimes compared to November 2022.
- **Firearm crimes rates are reasonably constant (minor fluctuations) compared to previous years; there is no alarming increase from 2018 to 2022.**
- Weekends typically see an increase in firearm crime rates, before decreasing again going into the follwing weekdays.
    - Friday to Saturday sees a 21.96% increase.
    - Sunday to Monday sees a 17.27% decrease.
- For the 509 Assult related crimes...
    - 332 (65.23%) have occurred at Community Locations.
    - 31.43% of these occurred in Auckland (3.4 times larger than the Christchurch (second-most)).

These are just some of the many insights we can derive from this dashboard. The interactivity of PowerBI also helps in filtering to find any hidden patterns buried in the data.
